        <h2>1. Abstract</h2>
        <p>House prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, making it essential to have a robust prediction model for accurate pricing. This project involved building a predictive model to estimate house prices using machine learning. The project covered data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the key features affecting house prices. Various machine learning models were trained and compared based on metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and latency time to identify the best-performing model. Finally, the chosen model was deployed using Docker for seamless integration and accessibility.</p>

        <h2>2. Insights I Found</h2>
        <p>During the analysis and modeling, several interesting insights were discovered:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Features Influencing House Prices:</strong> Location, property size, number of bedrooms, and proximity to amenities were the most significant factors influencing house prices.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact of Property Size and Location:</strong> Larger properties in prime locations had a steep price increase compared to smaller or mid-sized properties in less desirable areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Trends in Pricing:</strong> Seasonal trends and economic indicators also showed a correlation with property prices, suggesting market conditions significantly affect pricing models.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Steps I Took</h2>
        <p>Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the approach I followed to complete the project:</p>
        
        <div class="project-steps">
            <h3>a. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Handled missing values by using imputation techniques and removing unnecessary data.</li>
                <li>Performed outlier removal to prevent skewed model predictions.</li>
                <li>Created new features (e.g., price per square foot) to enhance model performance.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>b. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
            <p>Used visualizations like heatmaps and distribution plots to uncover patterns and correlations in the data.</p>

            <h3>c. Training Different ML Models</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Trained multiple machine learning models including <strong>Linear Regression</strong>, <strong>Decision Trees</strong>, <strong>Random Forests</strong>, and <strong>XGBoost</strong>.</li>
                <li>Compared performances using RMSE, MSE, and Latency Time to evaluate each model.</li>
                <li>Conducted hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>d. Model Comparison and Selection</h3>
            <p>Compared models and chose <strong>XGBoost</strong> for its high accuracy and efficiency in handling non-linear relationships.</p>

        <h2>4. Conclusions</h2>
        <p>The project successfully demonstrated how machine learning can be used to predict house prices with high accuracy. The use of XGBoost as the final model provided a reliable balance of speed and accuracy, making it ideal for real-time applications. This project also highlighted the importance of understanding data through EDA, as well as the need for proper feature engineering and model tuning. Future enhancements could include incorporating more dynamic features such as market trends and economic indicators to improve prediction accuracy.</p>
